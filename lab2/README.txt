To run the program:

The file main.py contains assignment 1 and 2. Just run "python main.py" to see the output of sum-product. 
For running max-sum it is necessary to comment line 85-92 and uncomment from 94-end

The file assignment3.py contains the code to create the Markov Random Field for the image and run Max-Sum on it.

The file Node contains all the parts of the algorithm, implemented as described in the assignment.

Answer to 1.8:
We now know the (marginal) a posteriori likelihood of each value of each node individually, 
but as the variables are not independent we do not know which combination of values is the MAP state.
