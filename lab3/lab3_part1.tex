\section*{1.}

$Q$ approximates $p(\Theta|D)$, this can be seen from the input to the KL divergence, as given in equation 11 in Bishop99.

\section*{2.}

However, the expression given in eq. 13 for $Q_i$ contains a small mistake. Starting with the expression for the lower bound $\mathcal{L}(Q)$, derive the correct expression (and include your derivation). You can proceed as follows: first, substitute the factorization of $Q$ (eq. 12) into the definition of $\mathcal{L}(Q)$ and separate $\mathcal{L}(Q)$ into $Q_i$-dependent and $Q_i$-independent terms. At this point, you should be able to spot the expectations $\langle\cdot\rangle_{k \neq i}$ over the other $Q$-distributions that appear in Bishop's solution (eq. 13). Now, keeping all $Q_k, k \neq i$ fixed, maximize the expression with respect to $Q_i$. You should be able to spot the form of the optimal $ln Q_i$, from which $Q_i$ can easily be obtained.

\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}(Q) &= \int Q(\*\theta) \ln \frac{P(D, \*\theta)}{Q(\*\theta)}d\*\theta \\
Q(\*\theta) &= \prod_i Q_i(\theta_i)
\end{align*}

Substitute in Q, write out the natural logarithm, split the integral, pull $Q_i(\theta_i)$ out of the product and rewrite as the rest as an expectation:

\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}(Q) &= \int \prod_i Q_i(\theta_i) \ln \frac{P(D, \*\theta)}{\prod_i Q_i(\theta_i)}d\*\theta \\
&= \int \prod_i Q_i(\theta_i) \ln P(D, \*\theta)d\*\theta - \int \prod_i Q_i(\theta_i) \ln \prod_i Q_i(\theta_i)d\*\theta \\
&= \int Q_i(\theta_i) \prod_{k \neq i} Q_k(\theta_k) \ln P(D, \*\theta) d\*\theta - \int \prod_i Q_i(\theta_i) \ln \prod_i Q_i(\theta_i)d\*\theta \\
&= \int Q_i(\theta_i) \langle \ln P(D, \*\theta) \rangle_{k \neq i}  d\theta_i - \int \prod_i Q_i(\theta_i) \ln \prod_i Q_i(\theta_i)d\*\theta \\
\end{align*}
